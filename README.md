# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge - Predicting Credit Risk

In this challenge, a machine learning model will be built that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

Use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Instructions

### Retrieve the data

In the `Generator` folder in `Resources`, there is a [GenerateData.ipynb](/Resources/Generator/GenerateData.ipynb) notebook that will download data from LendingClub and output two CSVs: 

* `2019loans.csv`
* `2020Q1loans.csv`

An entire year's worth of data (2019) will be used to predict the credit risk of loans from the first quarter of the next year (2020).

Note: these two CSVs have been undersampled to give an even number of high risk and low risk loans. In the original dataset, only 2.2% of loans are categorized as high risk. To get a truly accurate model, special techniques need to be used on imbalanced data. Undersampling is one of those techniques. Oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are other techniques that are also used.

## Preprocessing: Convert categorical data to numeric

Create a training set from the 2019 loans using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert the categorical data to numeric columns. Similarly, create a testing set from the 2020 loans, also using `pd.get_dummies()`. 

## Consider the models

Create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before creating, fitting, and scoring the models, make a prediction as to which model will perform better.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. Choose any starting hyperparameters that make sense. Which model performed better? How does that compare to the initial prediction? Write down results and thoughts.

## Revisit the Preprocessing: Scale the data

The data going into these models was never scaled, an important step in preprocessing. Use `StandardScaler` to scale the training and testing sets. Before re-fitting the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data, make another prediction about how scaling will affect the accuracy of the models. Write predictions down and provide justification.

Fit and score the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data. How do the model scores compare to each other, and to the previous results on unscaled data? How does this compare to the initial prediction? Write down results and thoughts.
